This project is a companion to the [React Realtime LED Dashboard](https://github.com/pprimm/iot-led-dashboard) and the [ESP8266 LED](https://github.com/pprimm/iot-esp) projects.  The purpose is to subscribe to the `get/bots/+/pot` topic on the MQTT broker and relay that topic value to a corresponding `set/bots/{name]/led` topic based on the definitions in `connect-list.js`.  

More description to come once the demo project is complete.
